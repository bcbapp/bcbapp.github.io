Here’s the start of the comic!\nThe BCB archive has undergone a lot of reworking over the years, and what you’re seeing here (and afterward) is the final result of edits, redraws and recolourings for the Bittersweet Candy Bowl Omnibus. This comic is as polished as it can be now, a balance of the simplicity and charm of the old art but a whole lot less scribbly.\nThe “first posted” dates reflect the original version of the chapter, but the first 850 pages were all enhanced in 2020.\nSo to all new readers, welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay!",

He’s the fastest runner, he’s considered handsome, he’s a real nice guy to boot.. and he’s got his team of adoring fangirls to back it up.\nOver time this perfect character has become one of the most controversial characters in the comic for.. reasons you’ll see!

Meanwhile right now it’s something Lucy doesn’t get into much. During the rewrite of the comic I tried to be more conscious about it, because in the past I honestly would forget!!\nBut it’s quite intentional when you see people care about her partial deafness, and who is actually considerate to it, keep a watchful eye..\nFor those who don’t get the apple reference, think Snow White and soon you’ll understand."

Korats even have really sensitive hearing.. so yeah.. but by the time I thought that was more fitting, page three was done, dialogue and all. So I erased the dialogue on a few panels and rewrote it. Thank god I drew with pencils!\nObviously, this nugget of information is outdated because then I went ahead and digitally redrew/rewrote all these pages, but it reflects the stage the comic was in about here. Figuring all this stuff out as I went!\nAlso, Daisy is the most adorable character ever. Although I feel bad because Ragamuffins are said to be particularly big cats.. and Daisy’s really small. IT’S HER REX TAKING CHARGE, that’s why she’s so small. Yeah.. YEAH. Perhaps her growth spurt will come soon…"

Maybe she’s versatile and does multiple subjects.. what a catch.\nMore demonstration of Mike’s supernatural hearing abilities.. if only he could stick to listening to whispers instead of random radios beside trash cans.\nIn the original version of these comics, I had a habit of making Lucy’s nose disappear since her nose is red.. not black like the majority of the other characters. Everyone else HAS to have a nose visible, but Lucy’s nose always has to be uncoloured, so it became a habit where I removed it entirely.\nIn the old series, I used to specifically draw her uncolored nose, but it used to come out looking really big compared to the others.. so for cuteness factor, I used to not have her with the nose.. and that trait became necessary for anyone who had a red nose.. it just shouldn’t be drawn unless the character specifically had a big nose.\nGood thing I later started giving her the nose again and fixed the issue entirely in the remake..

Pretty much how she’s meant to be.\nIn the side-story I made as a teen, she was the bloody QUEEN of doing that. Lucy would go on a tangent and Lily would spout out something that would make Lucy quiver in realisation… Lily was very good at dramatic one-liners.

Time slowed to a crawl over in BCB land..\nOne amusing bit to add is that I actually did RESEARCH to find what books to have Mike reading. My friend was going to ninth grade at the time and he was made to read “Things Fall Apart”.. so that’s why I chose that as the book for Mike to read.

Abby just makes me think too much of Abigail although it’s already a girly name.. I don’t know how an “e” makes a difference, BUT IT DOES TO ME DAMMIT.\nAnyway, isn’t it funny that a codename for a character led to me calling his father Abraham, and led to me slowly developing a reason as to why Abbey doesn’t want to be referred to as Abraham. THE PIECES ALL FELL IN PLACE."

I didn’t realize the coincidence until later! Seriously, Lucy hits anyone that touches her, but when I found that out, it amused me.\nIf I got that information wrong, feel free to correct me!

Mike was able to grab a rock earlier so it’s not like they came out of nowhere!\nYou can notice Lucy’s fear flare up for a second there.. obviously, it wasn’t as extreme in the past.. at this time, it was just typical fear of water because she can’t swim.

That should surely be a confidence boost!\nSo instead Lucy and Mike sank like rocks only for Paulo to jump in and rescue them both.

I guess it was also because I wanted to make the dialogue natural and good.. which was only fully corrected in the redraw/rewrite! I definitely like it much better these days, and I like the three weird girls. That was probably why I was fatigued in the first place. Because of their pattern of speech.\nThe three weird girls (taken from the pre-BCB comics I used to draw) have always been this way: the one to the left always speaks in questions, the one in the middle speaks in exclamations, and the one on the right speaks sort of flirtatious way or ends her sentences with an ellipsis. VERY SILLY MEME, BUT I LIKED IT. That’s probably why I had trouble with this page, initially! I had to follow specific rules, but now I have Souppy as an editor!

And now they’re not, but this comic still is! It took a lot of work, but I was pretty determined to keep it,\nI thought it was fun, there’s a lot of cute jokes, it depicts some nice development with Sue and McCain, and I thought some of the parts could still be recovered. It’s not like Sue didn’t stop feeling inferior, and I like the idea of Sue doing something petty like this! I felt it woulda been a disservice for Sue to have this one Sue-specific chapter be canned, so I wanted to save it.\nUltimately, I realised I created a lot of official minor characters that could fill the roles that needed to be replaced in this comic, and this is the result!\nI honestly really like this change because I feel the original Out of the Frame was a little more mean-spirited? Which I didn’t want to maintain.\nBesides, Katie would absolutely be jealous and eager to join a group if it meant getting more popularity! She fits into the role very well, and so the chapter wrote itself!\nAlso really happy to have another opportunity to utilise the three girls."

Half the time we’re just wearing accessories and nothing else, you guys, get with the program!\nThis segment of the chapter was considerably rewritten because I wanted to find a good way to get Tess up on stage that wasn’t hackneyed or forced, and I thought her family donating computers (as they did in the previous version) was super lame because you should be thanking her parents for doing that, not her! It doesn’t make any sense!!! What a random thing to get her on stage for!\nMeanwhile I remember pep rallies having nonsense teacher-vs-student games and I can see Tess participating in those, but not wanting to actually speak.. and being shoved into an uncomfortable situation by another, bitter student. I just felt that sequence flowed better.",

It didn’t feel as necessary here. It would also mean the Omnibus woulda taken.. like.. two more years to make. It would have been ridiculous. It was already ridiculous enough I redrew all of Volume One!\nSo the art isn’t going to be as strong for a while since I pretty much just tweaked a lot of areas and the colours were changed to match the aesthetic of Volume 2.

The gap was so long a lot of people thought I ended the comic before I updated with “Wonderland”!\nI guess the advantage of that original update schedule was that once I updated, there’d be a ton of pages to read. By Summer Vacation the comic was getting more and more complicated and I was beginning to plan it out for the long-term.\nSo, uh, see you Wednesday! (Way back then.)",

I didn’t really care about politics and didn’t bother to get informed. Souppy was actually very aware of politics because he comes from a politically-minded family so he was always a leftist.\nIn my 2021 eyes I see Abbey as a conservative (Though not a full-on Young Republican because Abbey isn’t evil lol), Sue is a liberal, and Daisy is the intelligent, thoughtful, aggressive leftist :) I am not biased here, I am just correct.\nIt’s sad how overtime Sue acquired the trait of being a lib. She tries so hard!!!! She’s actually very good!!! She is totally predisposed to being compassionate to others and doing what’s good for everybody!! But I dunno, Sue also lets emotions take over a lot of the time, and has biases she needs to address.",

I wanted Lucy to be angry because they used Paulo and treated him like a prop, not about his sexual performance. The old dialogue missed the mark.\nThis makes Rachel look much meaner and dismissive as well, which makes Lucy’s anger a lot more understandable.\nI felt the other issue with Rachel’s old dialogue is that it seemed like she was infodumping? It was a delicate balance of trying to get her to spill enough information, but not enough to just sound like an infodumper. What a page this was!"

It’s kinda weird to see it develop!\nPaulo’s swearing follows my own journey I went through when it came to swearing. When I was a kid and early teenager, I NEVER swore. I would use word-replacements for swears. Often that affected my writing! I couldn’t have characters swear because *I* couldn’t swear!\nA lot of the reason why a lot of the old Volume One dialogue was so wonky in the first place was because I had that affliction affect everything. I used to write formally. My brother told me once that using “cuz” instead of “because” in dialogue looked stupid, he thought “I dunno” looked sloppy compared to “I don’t know” so I HAD to write “because” and “I don’t know.\" God I had a lot of weird messed up rules.\nSo nobody could speak in slang, which affected characters like Paulo and Daisy considerably! That’s changed since then, of course, and I’ve been able to get characters to use words I don’t ever use, but feel fitting for them.\nAnyway, there you go!"

						"veronica": "HEY EVERYBODY!!!\nWELCOME TO A NEW CHAPTER!!!!!!!!!!\n.. Or is it? *Some* of you may find this sequence veryyyyyy familiar…\nIt’s “Dinner Time”, a Bittersweet Club International member-exclusive chapter that takes place in the midst of Volume Three. When Souppy and I were working on the omnibus, we thought this was a very valuable chapter to include as part of the canon story, and so we posted it while that campaign was running, as a flashback. Now it’s in its rightful place in the archive, happening whe nit was supposed to happen!\nBack when BCI started out, there were a few times I would draw canonical stories that honestly deserved to be real chapters! It happened with “Another Trip” (Remade into “Escape Route”), and it’s happened with Dinner Time now. It took a bit of time to settle on the AUs that fill the members’ archive now.\nI always regretted Dinner Time being trapped behind a paywall, because there’s a lot of Lucy’s mother here, a character who’s not often depicted. This chapter shows that she was certainly aware something was up with Lucy, but felt a bit powerless about how she should deal with it, as she didn’t want to smother."

Basically, I thought the youngest sibling is going to die last (because of their age), so for some reason I didn’t want the youngest sibling to be a boy?? Or for a main character to not be the youngest sibling? I guess because I projected myself into the youngest siblings and I didn’t want to die??\nGod even as a very young child I had awful agonising thoughts about mortality. What’s wrong with me\nANYWAY, I remember I created a younger sister for Lucy, but panicked at the thought of Lucy dying before her, so I made the younger sister admit in the next comic that not only is she OLDER than Lucy, but she’s Lucy’s cousin.\nWhat am I getting at? What I’m getting at is that in the original series I made when I was a child, Mike had a baby sister. Like a real baby. I think her name was Crystal? I actually forget what her name is now.. it’s been so long since I thought about her.\nEven though the thought of Lucy dying before anyone else horrified me, I was totally okay with Mike dying before Haley and Crystal! Because they were girls!\nAnd so to combat my crazy-ass child brain, I decided to make Crystal into a boy in the BCB world.. and that’s why we have Chris!",

You really expect Abbey and Daisy, two teenage kids, going out to another freaken city and figuring out the mystery of what happened to his mother over the course of a few days? Quite ridiculous!\nIt made more sense for Janet to tell Abbey to just go to his party, she will do the research."

The reason we were late was because somebody broke into our house and stole the main computer that I use to upload the pages. I was able to reconstruct things in order to post an older version, but it took some time to pull the settings out of backup. If you’re interested in the story of the break-in, [I wrote about it in my Tumblr blog](http://su.itca.se/post/16926718661/burgled). Anyway, enjoy the page.\n(Out of date commentary now, but interesting, isn’t it? These days I keep my iMac chained to a radiator.)"

						"veronica": "This chapter is admittedly very personal to me because similar to Abbey, I often get hit with flashbacks and past memories. My brain is always screaming, and sometimes one little thing I see, feel or hear will send me off to recall a much more unpleasant memory.\nSo Abbey having Janet brushing the back of his head lead him to think back to his mother brushing the back of his head during a very unfortunate conversation, is just a MOOD, you know? A lot of these sequences where he’s flashing back are, for me. This is what Abbey’s head is like a lot of the time!\n.. Fortunately unlike Abbey, I haven’t had what happened to him happen to me!! So, uhh!! Well!!! But the brain processes I totally relate to, and used that to write these scenes."

She said something like “but you can be pretty scary at school”. I guess I wanted her to have a reason to bring up Abbey’s violent tendencies? Why would she do that!! At this moment!!! Not only is it irrelevant, it’s just kinda mean!\nDaisy’s never expressed any actual intimidation in response to Abbey’s moods, she’s been very understanding!\nSo we rewrote it so that Daisy is supportive but in her naïveté, it leaves Abbey to reflect on how Daisy’s compliments for assertiveness can actually reflect badly on him in a different light.\nI feel this is much better, especially because it shows Abbey feeling genuine guilt about something that the other people in the car are praising him for! I guess because they don’t have the full picture.."

I was honestly super flattered being in the original list of 300 in the first place, like “Wow, my comic has been noticed by someone and I’m not a big dumb nobody”, but I totally did not expect to last this long, let alone win! Seriously, I don’t know how to feel about this. I honestly just expected to get my ass kicked by homestuck like four rounds ago hahahaha\nSERIOUSLY EVERY ROUND I WAS LIKE\n“I JUST WANTED TO LOSE TO HOMESTUCK ;\\_\\_;”\nThe large amount of support, especially from people who I did not expect, is really appreciated ;\\_\\_; thank you so much everyone, I hope I can make it up to you guys somehow. I’ll keep trying my best with every page, and I hope despite the rocky road ahead (plot-wise) you guys will stick around\nThere was a surprise we were planning to do sometime in the future, like middle or end of the year, but as something in return to the many hundreds of you who kept on voting I’m gonna try very very hard to get it all ready by the first page of the next chapter. I hope the wait is worth it!\nI am humbled and flabbergasted and confused and a bit seasick (having been on a boat for the past two days) and yeah, you guys should really check out all the comics in [the contest](http://www.comicmix.com/mix-march-madness-webcomics-tournament/2013/03/31/the-2013-mix-march-madness-webcomics-tournament-winner-is/)! The real value (besides the huge charity donation it generated among all the comics) is in introducing new readers to comics they haven’t heard of before, and if you have any free time, you should check some of them out! There was a good mix this year."

I feel sorta bad because I initially wanted the weekday updates to begin today (Mainly as a reward for you guys making me win the Mix March Madness thing like seriously I can’t get over how that happened and I am still surprised and everything and thank you i love you) because I think this page is better off with the next page seen right away and I’m hella nervous about it, but whatchugonnado.\nI sorta ran out of time to be able to make enough buffer to survive May, so I guess you get a month of crazy ol’ cliffhangers with days between them. Of course, we’re still in line to start the five-days-a-week thing in June."

It’s the stuff that happened in Degrassi a lot (half of the graduates in that show were either in a band or in a movie or modelling and it was really silly) so this was more of a parody of that.\nBut having the first page up for a few days could make people think I was actually being serious and like “WOW THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN/DID BCB JUMP THE SHARK” and yeah that doesn’t happen WHAT IS THIS DEGRASSI\nhello i’m explaining the joke because i don’t want people to think i would have actually done such a dumb thing WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR"

Band](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1800221632/band-vs-band-comix-volume-1), the visually fantastic throwback to an era that probably never happened. I have no doubt this book will be super impressive. Second, there’s [Lighter Than Heir](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nalem/lighter-than-heir-book-kickstarter), a second attempt at funding a first volume which is now.. already funded! This is a fun, engaging story in an imaginative world, and we know a lot of readers are fans. Help Nalem along with a few more pledges, she deserves the success!"

He was incredibly supportive to us, and went far out of his way to see us at literally every Australian convention we attended except one. He had many little influences on the comic, helping with proofreading our book drafts, sorting comments, and just generally being a super nice guy who was always looking for ways to support this comic. There’s not much a page comment on a webcomic can do to properly memorialise a person, but we wanted to give him a shout-out here in case he’d appreciate it. RIP. We’ll miss you."

We wanted to minimise friction and encourage more of the thoughtful, funny comments we’ve always adored from you guys. Many times I worked on new message boards, imageboards, weird new ideas for user commentary — I have some cool mockups scribbled away — but the answer never seemed to be in a new section of the website.\nA lot of internet things Vero and I grew up with (Ezboard, DeviantArt groups, site-specific forums, isolated comments systems) are considered old-hat these days, and as tough as it is to admit it, there are many good reasons why that’s the case. **Reader conversations can and should take place in reader-owned spaces** — Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, personal blogs and other generalised places of discussion. This is how the web works now, and (we think!) it’s for the better.\nWe’ll facilitate the process where we can. **We’re soon adding a section below each page that’ll help you find conversations and contribute your own.** We’ve worked to stimulate discussion over on Tumblr [with our blog](http://bittersweetcandybowl.tumblr.com/), we’re looking into doing more on Facebook, and we’re always open to talk to you guys [through](http://twitter.com/SuitCase874) [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Taeshi). Notably, **we plan to highlight reader comments we encounter (we’ll keep reading!) and share them prominently when we find them.**\nBut, ultimately, this is us letting go and handing over the reins to you guys. We believe in you!\nA sincere thank you from the two of us for the many years of wonderful comments — don’t stop now!"

It’s the same style you might have seen at [Ask Roseville High](http://askbcb.tumblr.com) lately, but with some refinement.\nWe want to thank everyone who came over the weekend to watch our marathon drawstream (or, drawathon) which lasted 39 hours over three days. We thank you for all the amazing support, giving us a lot of chat topics, buying a bunch of books, and pledging to [our new Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/bcb). It was a big exhausting success.\nPlease excuse the state of the BCB site for a little while as we recover from it all. All we really want to communicate today is: check [the Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bcb) if you haven’t already (all pledges go towards next month’s stream!) and check out [all the weekend’s drawings on Candybooru](http://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/candybooru/post/list/Draw_Stream/1)!"

						"oliver": "Here’s the big change! And to a new reader… it’s nothing?\nBasically, the big deal is that the rest of the chapter looks like THIS and not like a BCI comic. In late 2015 when this chapter was posted, Veronica was still getting used to the new style introduced in Guest of Honor, we had scheduled a holiday where she wouldn’t be able to work on new pages, and the buffer was about to run out. So the solution was found: update at the normal rate, but finish Golden Hour in the sketchy BCI style that’s way quicker.\nObviously, we knew we had to get around to finishing it in the proper style in time for Volume Six, and so in late 2018 Veronica spent a bit over a month finishing all twenty-five pages. Hidden work goes into every book we publish (for example, all the drawing corrections made for Volumes Four and Five required a lot of work from both of us, as patching over watercolour is a lot more complex) and the hidden work in Volume Six involved redrawing 25 pages everyone already read. Two months of page updates, two months that could otherwise go into the page buffer and avoid hiatuses and update schedule changes, but two months that had to be spent!\nSo for old readers, while you might have already read these pages, please enjoy the changes!\nFor new readers, it’s like nothing ever happened! We hope.\nAs a bonus: check out [a comparison of this page to the older style,](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/misc/90-18-comparison.gif) and [a comparison of page 28 to the older style](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/misc/90-28-comparison.gif)."

Has nobody else in the world been so mad and frustrated by someone that they vent about wanting them to stop existing anymore?? It doesn’t mean that if that actually happened, the person saying that would be DELIGHTED.\nIt makes me think of a teenager yelling “I HATE YOU MOM” during an argument and that being held against them as some sort of ultimate sin when the reality is the teenager was furious in the heat of the moment and any of their past/future behaviour will show that.\nAnyway, I dunno, tangent!"

SO I FLIPPED THE CANVAS HORIZONTALLY AND REORGANISED THINGS THAT WAY. fun in catching blunders\nand speaking of comic blunders, I soon realised I made that same blunder in Pillow Talk and Feline Filibuster so i’M A BIG SCREW-UP WHOOPS. It’s something I will fix in the future."

For a while Souppy wanted Daisy to DECIPHER what Paulo implied, but the line was always just too vague for Daisy to figure out convincingly. So there was so much writing and rewriting and at one point.. WELL WE MADE IT. It’s there.\nThis page was just a demon when it came to the balancing act of characters infodumping realistically."

After a lot of dialogue puzzling, I ended up finding another problem that made more sense to me, and so I rewrote Augustus’s dialogue to incorporate it.. but hey! I’m a law school kid who dropped mathematics as soon as they let me. So please enjoy my rudimentary algebra that probably gets all the words wrong. (Jordan, you’re not alone.)\nBy the way, [we finally have our Daisy:](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/taeshi/bittersweet-candy-bowl-volume-five)\n![Daisy plush mockup](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/misc/daisyplush.jpg)\nThat’s right! It’s the Daisy plush! (Prototype.) Just in the nick of time, with only five days to go. Now would be a great time to [back the Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/taeshi/bittersweet-candy-bowl-volume-five) for a Volume Five, a Daisy plush, an acrylic charm, or any of the other cool things while you still can!!"

Most notably, the first half of Volume Five now has outlines around speech bubbles, which was a whole lot of work but now it’s done. Otherwise, it’s the product of our frenzied readings and re-readings in the leadup to printing, and represents something made a little better with a couple years of hindsight.\nYou can see everything on the new, improved [Archive page](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/archive.html)! Where yes, finally, Volume Four and Five get their own section. It’s all a little tidied up (and now mobile-friendly.) BINGE SOME OLD COMICS TODAY.",

Please send all your birthday wishes to [her Twitter](https://twitter.com/taeshi), [mail her something sweet](http://bittersweetcandybowl.tumblr.com/post/141459497436/hi-i-want-to-send-you-guys-some-stuff-but-i), or if you’re inclined, just draw some damn good BCB fanart and put it on [Candybooru](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/candybooru/)!

It’s a very cute look! Clearly inspired by [the gym clothes in Cardcaptor Sakura](https://ccsakura.fandom.com/wiki/Tomoeda_Elementary_School_Uniforms#Summer_P.E_Uniform).\nI’ve admittedly considered dressing the BCB crew in that kind of gear when they would go to gym since I remember I had to change to gym clothes back in High School. But I know dressing them up would create annoying “wHy DoN’t ThEy WeAr ClOtHeS oUtSiDe Of GyM cLaSs” remarks which has DEMOTIVATED me from doing it!!!\nLess for me to draw at least!!\n(Katie and Stacy normally wear clothes, though, so reasonably they would change into uniforms.)\nJust imagine, if they were humans they’d *have* to switch into gym clothes during gym and not actually wear what they went to school with. Getting your normal clothes all sweaty… fughfgkhfgk"

Welcome to a new chapter!!\nI’m sure CERTAIN characters need to be dealt with.. but let’s see how these happy seniors are doing for now!\nSPEAKING OF HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY SOUPPY!!! It is his birthday today, the 21st of July! Please give him every kind wish in the world (and if you wanna draw him anything, he does like MikexLucy and PauloxDaisy lmao).\nSouppy works so hard for this comic, he keeps the lights on while I work on the comic itself, which isn’t easy!! He deserves a break! And some cake! And some delicious food! I love you, Souppy ;\\_\\_; My wonderful bub~! Happy birthdayyyyy!"

All in good fun! WE DIDN’T WANT TO STOP EVEN THOUGH OUR SHOULDERS WERE ACHING.\n.. not a very fortunate comparison to a certain pink-ribboned cat..\n..

						"veronica": "Hey, everyoneeeeee!! It’s time for.. uhh.. a new chapter. That is not quite a chapter.. and not quite an intermission..\nI’ve been musing about this sequence a lot! This is actually supposed to be a canonical conversation that took place in Eternal Flame after Mike came back from seeing Lucy, but at the time I was REALLY fatigued by there being not one, but TWO phone conversations in the chapter already.. and I kinda liked the mystery.\nI sorta wanted the information of this call to spill out in the following chapters as a result of me omitting it.. for the readers to pick up the pieces over time.\nAnd that’s why these pages are done in the BCI style rather than made into actual pages. I don’t plan to redraw this to insert into Eternal Flame! This is an optional extra. I still want to tell the story by having information come out over time (and much already has!)\nKinda show don’t tell in a way.. though there’ll be plenty of telling since a lot of this involves Sandy having to talk on the phone LOL\nSo why am I posting this sequence? Well, I think it’s a fun sequence now that I had time to think it over and polish it up into comic form! It’s wayyyy more fleshed out than [the draft version that was posted on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/55061426) (Join for more cool bonuses like that.. there’s other sequences I’ve canned before and put up there… i can also draw you birthday requests)\nAnd the OTHER reason is that I’m traveling a lot so I needed an excuse to create quick buffer because the next chapter is going to involve a lot of complicated mall backgrounds HAHAHAHAHAH\nBut I think people will enjoy seeing a little more of Sandy come out here!"

To give it time to be properly edited and finished. And that is where this originally-meant-to-and-eventually-destined-to-be-a-BCI chapter comes in!!\nIt’s a fun one, though, I promise!! THINGS ARE GONNA GO A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY HERE… and you will see why\nBut yes I am definitely still working on the comic and I will get it out after this AU story ends, I promise ;\\_\\_; I am sorry ;\\_\\_; I hate doing this kinda thing, but I also would really hate to rush through this next chapter just for the sake of doing it and end up publishing RUSHED CONTENT.\nAlso I guess I’ve been slowly kicking away a REALLY BAD FLU i ended up catching on the family trip, like I’ve been super dead since I’ve come back from the trip despite coming back from the trip and IMMEDIATELY getting back to working on the next chapter. Like this flu was bad you guys, the kinda flu that makes you skip your damn period and have horrible fever and some vomiting spells!!! Would not recommend!!! Flu season has been awful, from the sounds of it, and I absolutely got rekt by it.\nBut nevertheless I PERSEVERED and kept working on this damn chapter hoping I wouldn’t have to post a BCI in-between chapters!! I suppose that’s another reason why I’ve been fighting this flu for like a month now, I literally have NOT allowed myself to properly rest, even during the family trip LMAOOOOOOOOO there was one (1) day I was so sick I was bedridden and I still wanted to dizzily join the family on their antics…\nvery cool…\nanyway this sounds like me being a student explaining why I need an extension on my assignment to my professor (the reader), I hope you can forgive me lmao bUT I SWEAR THIS BCI IS SO GOOD. I had fun writing it!!!! I know a lot of people have been like “WHY DIDN’T MIKE PUT DOWN THE DAMN PHONE” and perhaps… we will see what happens…"

Will Paulo and the group crash James and Mike’s big night out? Will Mike break up with Sandy? Will James get extra butter on his popcorn? You’ll have to read to find out!!\n.. at one day a week!!!!\n:’D\nSouppy has written a good summary of our CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS in the news post, but I am very sorry for this tragic news. I feel like this past.. couple of years after dedicating so much time to the omnibus, I have just never been able to fully catch up. And we have some stuff we want to announce, but it just feels bad having to do all of it in a rush.\nSo we are gonna update once a week for at least this chapter, maybe more. When you wake up to make a page, go to sleep having made a page and repeat the same process over and over for weeks on end, the days just start blurring together and I want a break from that.\nAnyway enough sob story excuses since I feel quite terrible about it. In better news this chapter owns and it’s the best chapter to start with the new schedule because EVERY PAGE WILL KEEP YOU GUESSING!!! Hahahah!!!\nALSO we are gonna have the “February” stream this Friday! Because we won’t be free to do the stream in actual February! More posts to come about that on [the BCB Patreon](https://patreon.com/bcb).\nSo in short: next update is Monday, patrons are always a page ahead, and we are doing a stream this Friday at 1pm!

In some ways I am discovering new things about some new characters at the same time as Mike.\nAnyway I developed a background in my head about Felix and James so that’ll be a fun thing to tackle in the future!"

James is trying to get with a taken guy, that sucks!

						"veronica": "Hello and welcome to a new chapter!!!! Wow!!!!\nOr is it new… technically it shouldn’t be.\nSouppy and I have been slowly working on Omnibus 2 (secret revealed!) and we are taking opportunities to fix little things that have bugged me about the story. With Omnibus 1, as you know, it was a lot. Omnibus 2 doesn’t need as much of that kind of tweaking, thankfully! I’m pretty happy with Volumes 4-6! HOWEVER…\nAfter rereading Volume Six, I found some issues in the arc where Paulo gives Daisy the silent treatment. Admittedly, around the time those chapters were written, I was already planning Lucy’s return, and I got so fixated and excited about bringing Lucy back to the story that I got impatient.. and as a result, I kind of neglected this storyline! Plus there were so many Paulo-centric chapters before Volume Six, and I technically had to draw [“Golden Hour”](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/c90/p1) twice because of how it was initially posted in sketch form… so man, I was getting a little sick of writing about him. I wanted Lucy back! I wanted Lucy to cause some chaos, challenge the dynamics of the group! That was exciting to me!\nSo I wrapped up that thread a bit too quickly.. and as a result, the arc didn’t develop as well as I wanted it. Why was Paulo so mad at Daisy? I think it makes sense if you read between the lines, but it was all too subtle. It’s not crazy to wonder: how come he ignored Daisy when they returned to school, right after having had such a meaningful important conversation with Matt? Didn’t that conversation tell Paulo know that he’s capable of good? How come he went back to his old womanising habits?\nI justified it in my head that Paulo spent summer vacation stewing about [the phone call with Daisy,](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/c90/p11) feeling wronged by her, but also being fearful of being around Daisy because of Abbey. Paulo was genuinely scared of Abbey. Perhaps becoming what Abbey expects of him (a womanising jerk) will finally get Daisy off his back for good. She implied he is capable of cruelty, after all! Why not give that to her? Daisy can then leave him alone, and so Abbey won’t threaten him anymore. Two birds, one stone, right?\nSome readers have kind of determined that was what was going on in his head - but this is too much stuff that wasn’t shown. And that’s why this chapter is being made! To bolster the weakest part of the story.\nThis chapter is supposed to take place between [“Ice Block”](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/c90.1/p1) and [“Dial Tone.”](https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/c91/p1) It will be inserted further back in the archive once Omnibus 2 is ready, but for now it runs as a new chapter.\nAnyway, that’s enough of me babbling! I hope you enjoy this chapter! I tried my best to emulate the Volume Six style, so enjoy a blast from the past!"
